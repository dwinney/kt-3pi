abstract="The Khuri--Treiman formalism models the partial-wave expansion of a scattering amplitude as a sum of three individual truncated series, capturing the low-energy dynamics of the direct and cross channels. We cast this formalism into dispersive equations to study {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pi {\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}$\pi$$\pi$scattering, and compare their expressions and numerical output to the Roy and GKPY equations. We prove that the Khuri--Treiman equations and Roy equations coincide when both are truncated to include only S- and P-waves. When higher partial waves are included, we find an excellent agreement between the Khuri--Treiman and the GKPY results. This lends credence to the notion that the Khuri--Treiman formalism is a reliable low-energy tool for studying hadronic reaction amplitudes.",

abstract = "The general analysis of binary reactions involving particles with arbitrary spin is reformulated in such a way, that it applies equally well to relativistic particles (including photons). This is achieved by using longitudinal spin components (“helicity states”) not only in the initial and final states, but also in the angular momentum states which are employed as usual to reduce theS-matrix to a simpler form. Expressions for the scattering and reaction-amplitude, intensity and polarization are given. They involve fewer vector-addition coefficients than the customary formulas, and no recoupling coefficients. The application to some examples is sketched, and in the Appendix some formulas are given that may be of use in the applications."
